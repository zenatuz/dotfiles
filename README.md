# My personal dotfiles

This repo keep my personal customization files that I use to personalize my terminal experience.

I got this idea from this video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK2JE2YsKto>, after that, I got a lot of more customizations.

> This can be applied on Linux, Mac or Windows (WSL).

There is a script called [.install.sh](.install.sh) that do the initial setup of all tools (**zsh, oh-my-zsh, powerlevel10k theme, oh-my-zsh plugins, brew packages and yadm**), and then applies the YADM at the end, which gets the current customizations on your home directory `~/`.

You can run the script directly with the following command:

```bash
curl -s -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zenatuz/dotfiles/main/.install.sh | bash
```

In the end, run the command to define ZSH as the default shell:

```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```

## Prompt

This is how your prompt will look like after cloning the settings with YADM.

- **Home directory**

- **Some project with git**

> To customize prompt, run `p10k configure` or edit ~/.p10k.zsh.

## Getting the DOTFILEs, only

If you only want to get the files without installing anything new, just use YADM in your home directory.

```bash
cd ~
yadm clone git@github.com:zenatuz/dotfiles.git
```

## Font

To enjoy this setting at its utmost performance, install **Firacode** from `Nerd Fonts` on your OS, and select `Firacode Nerd Font Retina` on your Terminal and Editor.

### **Windows Terminal**

### **VSCode**

In the VSCode `settings.json` apply these settings to enable **`Firacode Nerd Font`** on the integrated terminal.

```json
    "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "FuraCode Nerd Font Retina",
```

## WSL Additional Settings

To enforce some resource limitations on the WSL environment.

1 - Turn off all WSL instances such as docker-desktop

- `wsl --shutdown`

2 - Create/Edit the .wslconfig with:
- `notepad "%HOMEPATH%/.wslconfig"`

> Use the example on the file `.windows\.wslconfig`. More settings can be seen at the: [Official Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/wsl-config#configure-global-options-with-wslconfig).
